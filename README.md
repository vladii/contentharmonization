# Content Harmonization
In this folder are two complex tools:
- TextOverImage: given an image, a text, a font type and size, it produces (among others) an image with the text placed over it, in the proper place and with a nice color.
- SmartCrop: given an image and two values: width and height of the resulting image, it outputs a crop (a window) from the initial image, with the given size, which catches the most interesting points from the original image.

Note: More information about how they work (and demos) are presented in their folders.
